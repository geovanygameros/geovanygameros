# Hey there! I'm Geovany Gameros👨‍💻
### Developer, leader, friend and a passionate entrepreneur.

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating and designing high performance applications and micro-services. I've been a professional programmer since a bit more than 7 years and some of the technologies I love to working with are Ruby, ReacJS and recently React Native. I'm starting to enjoy working with a serverless architecture and realtime capabilities. 

I've been working as a Tech Lead in a few organizations, also on my free time I love creating, developing and testing ideas. Right know I'm building an IoT brand and I hope my products could disrupt the smart home's market being simple and affordable. Tomorrow maybe i get involved into ML algorithms or Big Data. I thing you catch the idea...
