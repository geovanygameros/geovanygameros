# Hey there! I'm Geovany Gameros👨‍💻
### Developer, leader, friend and a passionate entrepreneur.

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating and designing high performance applications and micro-services. I've been a professional programmer for more than 7 years. Some of the technologies I love to work with are Ruby, ReacJS, and recently, React Native. I'm lately getting into serverless architectures and realtime capabilities. 

I've been working as a Tech Lead in some organizations. Also, on my free time, I love creating, developing and testing ideas. I'm curently building an IoT brand and I hope my products disrupt the smart home's market being simple and affordable. Maybe tomorrow I'll get involved into ML algorithms or Big Data or whatever I find challenging. I think you got the idea...
